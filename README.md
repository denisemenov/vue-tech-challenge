# Objective

Build a simple frontend application using Vue that allows users to search for activities. This project is a small exercise, not a full production app, and should take just a few hours. We will evaluate your project based on quality (best practices and architecture).

# Requirements

We provide a `node-backend` project with an endpoint that serves activities: `/activities`.

- Create a Vue frontend that consumes the provided API and implements a user interface.
- The UI should display a list of activities and allow users to search for activities by title.
  - Display the following fields:
    - Title
    - Price (with currency)
    - Rating
    - Special offer status
- Decide whether to implement the filtering logic on the client or server. 
- Modify or add dependencies as needed.
- Document any features or improvements left out due to time constraints.
- Note down any assumptions you made.
